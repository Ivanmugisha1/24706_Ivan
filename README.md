This state machine manages a traffic light system with a cycle of Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red. Within the Red state, it handles pedestrian requests by switching to a pedestrian crossing mode when needed. The Green state has sub-states to manage active and warning phases. The system uses timers and pedestrian button presses to control transitions, allowing both vehicular and pedestrian traffic to be managed effectively.
